# Credit-Card-Validation
 In this program user is asked to enter credit card number and the program tells her if this credit card number is valid or not. 
 But the drawback of the program is that user have to enter single number of credit card at a time instead of entering the whole digit at single time. I know that this can be accompalish with the help of a string. 
 Will grateful to anyone who solve this prolem.
